### Short Description

A Silent Hill-like horror game project made in Godot with GDScript

## Lore

A man follows the trails down to his childhood village, he knows he's looking for something
but he just can't seem to find it. A voice lurks in the houses, calling his name. 
It sounds so familiar, and it brings the scent of flowers. He needs to find her.
